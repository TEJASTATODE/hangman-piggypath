              We believe young people don't lack intelligence, they lack engagement. 
              PiggyPath reimagines finance education with hands on actions, gamified 
              challenges and personalized learning that speaks to Gen Z. Think of 
              finance from an addictive app or fitness tracker paired in a practical, fun and 
              relatable way. No more guesswork, no scary learning and no pressure.
             We envision a generation that doesn't just survive adulthood, but owns it. By turning the mystery of finance into the fun of a game, we're building a future where every young adult has the clarity to dream big and the tools to actually get there, no jargon, no judgment, just progress.
